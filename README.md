# This repo is the coding challenge for Backend Engineer candidates.  
This flask app has three unimplemented methods, GET, POST, DELETE.  
Implement the endpoints to retrieve a name or list of names, insert a name and remove an entry from a 
database.  
Use either MySQL or Postgres as the database(dev's choice).        

# Instructions:
    1) clone the repo
    2) Implement the methods
    3) commit to your Github repo
    4) send us the link to your repo so we can evaluate
    5) bonus if you containerize the app
